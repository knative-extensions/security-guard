# This script builds all the YAMLs that Knative security-advisor publishes.
# It may be varied between different branches, of what it does, but the
# following usage must be observed:
#
# generate-yamls.sh  <repo-root-dir> <generated-yaml-list>
#     repo-root-dir         the root directory of the repository.
#     generated-yaml-list   an output file that will contain the list of all
#                           YAML files. The first file listed must be our
#                           manifest that contains all images to be tagged.

# Different versions of our scripts should be able to call this script with
# such assumption so that the test/publishing/tagging steps can evolve
# differently than how the YAMLs are built.

# The following environment variables affect the behavior of this script:
# * `$KO_FLAGS` Any extra flags that will be passed to ko.
# * `$YAML_OUTPUT_DIR` Where to put the generated YAML files, otherwise a
#   random temporary directory will be created. **All existing YAML files in
#   this directory will be deleted.**
# * `$KO_DOCKER_REPO` If not set, use ko.local as the registry.
