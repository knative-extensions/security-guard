# Guard User Interface

We are looking for volunteers to take an older UI tool ew PoCed, align it with the updated Guardian and add it here.

guard-ui is a UI tool for visualization and editing of Guardians.

Guardians are based on the [guard.security.knative.dev](../../pkg/apis/guard/v1alpha1/README.md) package.

To access Guardians, guard-ui uses the [guard-kubemgr](../guard-kubemgr/README.md) package.
