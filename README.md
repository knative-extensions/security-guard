# Security Guard

## Security - How Guard help secure Knative services
The core component of Guard is the [`guard-gate`](https:pkg/guard-gate) which can be used to extend Knative Queue Proxy. [`guard-gate`](https:pkg/guard-gate) monitor and potentialy block requests and/or responses to Knative services based on a per-service security configuration (Micro-rules). 

Micro-rules enable a fine grain filtering performed against each value delivered to/from the service.
By using micro-rules, [`guard-gate`](https:pkg/guard-gate) can identify the delivery of exploits targeting vulnerabilities embedded as part of the service or its dependencies.

When [`guard-gate`](https:pkg/guard-gate) and a proper set of micro-rules are used, offenders will typically be required to build dedicated delivery mechanisms in order to explore options for detecting and exploiting service vulnerabilities. This lengthy process may need to be repeated for each service, as each service maintains a different set of micro-rules. As a result, an offender will not be able to use common statistical attack patterns.  

Users of [`guard-gate`](https:pkg/guard-gate) gain Situational Awareness both thanks to alerts about out of pattern request/responses, and by the identification of security indicators that the service is misused. Such indicators include longer than usual  service times and the list of external IP addresses appraoched by the service. 

Beyond, Situational Awareness, [`guard-gate`](https:pkg/guard-gate) enables blocking out-of-pattern behaviours and the ability to react to potential attacks and/or to on-going attacks by introducing a fine-tune configrable security gate in front of the service.   

Overall the solution offers both visibility into the security of the service as well as the ability to monitor/block both known patterns and unknown patterns (using a zero day exploits).

## Solution components
This project adds:
1. [`guard-gate`](https:pkg/guard-gate) - the workload security gate
1. A *"Guardian"*  - an object implemented as either a CRD or a Configmap maintaining a set of micro-rules per service 
1. [`guard-learner`](https:cmd/guard-learner) - a learner service to auto learn the micro-rules stored in the *Guardian*  
1. [`guard-ui`](https:cmd/guard-ui) - a user interface web app to simplify manual configuration of micro-rules 

In addition, the project adds:
1. [`qpoption`](https:pkg/qpoption) - a package to enable using [`guard-gate`](https:pkg/guard-gate) with Knative Queue Proxy Option
1. [`test-gate`](https:pkg/test-gate) - a package to enable testing Knative Queue Proxy Options named 

## Guard Gate
[`guard-gate`](https:pkg/guard-gate) can be loaded as a knative queue proxy option using [`qpoption`](https:pkg/qpoption)

Once loaded, it monitors the proxied requests and responses and the pod network.

Note that [`guard-gate`](https:pkg/guard-gate) can also be used for more generic kubernetes use cases by loading:
- As a standalone reverse proxy, see for example: [`guard-rproxy`](https://github.com/IBM/workload-security-guard/tree/main/cmd/guard-rproxy)
- As an extension to any go proxy, for example by using: [`rtplugs`](https://github.com/IBM/go-security-plugs/tree/main/rtplugs).


## Guardian
[`guard-gate`](https:pkg/guard-gate) uses *Guardian* - a set of micro-rules that define the expected behaviour of the service.

The *Guardian* object maintains the following configuration parameters:
1. A control object which defines the workiing mode of Guard in relation to the service 
1. A learned set of micro-rules updated by [`guard-learner`](https:cmd/guard-learner) 
1. A manually configured set of micro-rules that can be updated using kubectl or using [`guard-ui`](https:cmd/guard-ui)  

Each service has its own respective *Guardian*. New services may use a default *Guardian* for the Kubernetes namespace or may use the default Guard *Guardian*. The following procedure describes how the *Guardian* for a service is found:
- *Guardian* may reside in a CRD (guardians.wsecurity.ibmresearch.com) under the name '\<servicename\>.\<namespace\>' or in a configmap under the name 'guardian-\<servicename\>'. 
- If a *Guardian* is not found, [`guard-gate`](https:pkg/guard-gate) will look for a namespace-default *Guardian* as a starting point under the name  '\<ns\>-\<namespace\>' or in a configmap under the name 'guardian-\<ns\>-\<namespace\>'.  
- If a namespace-default *Guardian* is not found, [`guard-gate`](https:pkg/guard-gate) will use an empty set of micro-rules as a starting point and will set itself to work in auto-learning mode 
 
See [`guard-gate`](https:pkg/guard-gate) for more details on the different Guard working modes.

## Guard Learner 
[`guard-learner`](https:cmd/guard-learner) is a standalone service used to learn *Guardian* micro-rules based on inputs from instances of [`guard-gate`](https:pkg/guard-gate). [`guard-learner`](https:cmd/guard-learner) stores the *Guardian* as a CRD (guardians.wsecurity.ibmresearch.com) under the name \<servicename\>.\<namespace\> or in a configmap under the name 'guardian-\<servicename\>'.

## Guard User Interface 
Although *Guardian* CRDs and Configmaps can be controled directly via kubectl. An optional [`guard-ui`](https:cmd/guard-ui) is offered to simplify and clarify the micro-rules.
